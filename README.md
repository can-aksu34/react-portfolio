My simple portfolio for developer built with React.

### [live preview](https://react-portfolio-canlevet.vercel.app/)

In summary, the workflow is designed to automatically deploy preview versions of the application on Vercel with each push to a branch other than main. It utilizes GitHub secrets for authentication and access to project information on Vercel.
